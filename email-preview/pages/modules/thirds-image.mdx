# Thirds Image Card

A card layout with an image displayed â…“ of the width.

The Thirds Image Card is responsive, in that the image and layout will scale down to mobile, but the layout is
static or fixed - that is the image will _not_ stack over the copy. Think of the Thirds Image card like a large CTA with additional detail.

## Usage

The Thirds Image card works best in series with other Thirds Image cards, alternating left-to-right layout,
to create a river-flow style layout.

Use to link to equal-priority items in a newsletter, or to emumerate equal-priority features in a product or service.

## Guidelines

-   Recommended image size is proportional to 408px wide by 600px tall (to display at 204px x 300px on high resolution displays).
-   Recommend a short headline. When a short headline is not available, forgo the headline for copy.
-   When using a CTA / button, consider linking the image for greater acccessibility
