# Split Image Card

A card layout split between an image and a small block of copy with a link.

The Split Image Card is responsive, in that the image and layout will scale down to mobile, but the layout is
static or fixed - that is the image will _not_ stack over the copy. Think of the Split Image Card like a large CTA with additional detail.

## Usage

The Split Image card works best in series with other Split Image Cards, alternating left-to-right layout,
to create a river-flow style layout.

Use to link to equal-priority items in a newsletter, or to emumerate equal-priority features in a product or service.

## Guidelines

-   Recommended image size is proportional to 600px wide by 600px tall (to display at 300px x 300px on high resolution displays).
-   Recommend a short headline. When a short headline is not available, forgo the headline for copy.
-   When using a CTA / button, consider linking the image for greater acccessibility
