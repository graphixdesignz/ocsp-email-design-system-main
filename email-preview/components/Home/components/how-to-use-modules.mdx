## How to use modules

To allow for greater control over email content and design, many modules may be configured by enabling or disabling features. Module features may be configured using the toggle selections above each module preview.

Some modules support color themes. Select a colorway from the available options to see colors applied.

Configurable module features may include:

-   Right to Left language support
-   Horizontal divider (to create visual separation between modules)
-   Addition and removal of headings, subheadings, images, and CTA buttons

When creating new recipes or templates, begin by copying and pasting the
master layout module into your email authoring environment to create the base template.
The master layout provides the responsive layout and global typographic styles.

To adjust a module, navigate to your preferred module, configure it as needed,
then copy and paste the generated HTML into the master template in your email authoring environment.
